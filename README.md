This mod makes foxes and players glow when they eat Glow Berries. Simple right? This should be in vanilla, anyway you can have it this way now!

### Configuration
You can adjust the duration of the glow effect using the gamerule `foxGlowDuration`. It takes one parameter which is the duration in seconds. (Without decimals)

`/gamerule foxGlowDuration <duration>`

For example, 2 seconds would be
`/gamerule foxGlowDuration 2`

You can toggle the effect for players using `doPlayersGlow`. The value `true` will enable the effect, `false` will disable it. It is active by default.

`/gamerule doPlayersGlow <true/false>`

For example, to disable the effect
`/gamerule doPlayersGlow false`

Also, as side note there also are some localizations of the gamerules in the World Creation screen.
